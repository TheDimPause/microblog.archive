If I'd planned this properly I'd also have taken  a photo of the finished dish 🙁.\n\nI was attempting a vegan version of a Brazilian [feijoada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feijoada), loosely inspired by Jamie Oliver's _[Smoky veggie feijoada](https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/vegetables-recipes/smoky-veggie-feijoada/)_.\n\n### Ingredients\n\n500g dried Brazilian carioca beans (or pinto)\n\n1 kg (~12) medium/large carrots  \n12 vegan sausages  \n\n2 red onions \n4 cloves garlic \n5 sticks celery  \n1 or 2 red/yellow peppers  \n1 large courgette  \n700g passata  \n1/4 bottle red wine  \n\n8-10 fresh bay leaves  \ncinnamon stick  \n2 tsp ground coriander  \n2 tsp smoked paprika (plus extra for roasting the carrots)  \nfresh and/or dried thyme  \nfresh coriander  \n\n### Method\n\nSoak the beans overnight then rinse and put in a large pan with plenty of water, 4 or 5 bay leaves and a cinnamon stick.

The vegan sausages I used were by [Naked Glory](https://nakedglory.co.uk/). Any will do as long as they are quite firm and don't disintegrate into the stew. \n\n2. [Carioca](https://www.souschef.co.uk/products/carioca-pinto-beans?s=recomatic). Beans or feijão are a large part of the Brazilian diet, and pinto beans or carioca are one of the firm favourites. The most popular lunch in Brazil includes a serving of white rice along with cooked beans - so much so that the phrase arroz com feijão the \"rice and beans\" is a colloquial term used to mean the \"basics\".  \n\n3.
