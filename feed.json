Mixed up and confused, but recognisable characters, scenes and lines from Durrell’s work. Missing and distorting so much but I did enjoy the experience - not nearly as bad as some reviews suggest!</p><p>The film is visually impressive (in parts excessive in a late 1960s way) and quite atmospheric. The performances of Dirk Bogarde, Michael York, Anouk Aimée, Anna Karina and others are worth seeing.</p><p>On the negative side the quality of the DVD transfer I watched was terrible 😞 </p>\n",

If I'd planned this properly I'd also have taken  a photo of the finished dish 🙁.\n\nI was attempting a vegan version of a Brazilian [feijoada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feijoada), loosely inspired by Jamie Oliver's _[Smoky veggie feijoada](https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/vegetables-recipes/smoky-veggie-feijoada/)_.\n\n### Ingredients\n\n500g dried Brazilian carioca beans (or pinto)\n\n1 kg (~12) medium/large carrots  \n12 vegan sausages  \n\n2 red onions \n4 cloves garlic \n5 sticks celery  \n1 or 2 red/yellow peppers  \n1 large courgette  \n700g passata  \n1/4 bottle red wine  \n\n8-10 fresh bay leaves  \ncinnamon stick  \n2 tsp ground coriander  \n2 tsp smoked paprika (plus extra for roasting the carrots)  \nfresh and/or dried thyme  \nfresh coriander  \n\n### Method\n\nSoak the beans overnight then rinse and put in a large pan with plenty of water, 4 or 5 bay leaves and a cinnamon stick.

The vegan sausages I used were by [Naked Glory](https://nakedglory.co.uk/). Any will do as long as they are quite firm and don't disintegrate into the stew. \n\n2. [Carioca](https://www.souschef.co.uk/products/carioca-pinto-beans?s=recomatic). Beans or feijão are a large part of the Brazilian diet, and pinto beans or carioca are one of the firm favourites.
