Mixed up and confused, but recognisable characters, scenes and lines from Durrell’s work. Missing and distorting so much but I did enjoy the experience - not nearly as bad as some reviews suggest!</p><p>The film is visually impressive (in parts excessive in a late 1960s way) and quite atmospheric. The performances of Dirk Bogarde, Michael York, Anouk Aimée, Anna Karina and others are worth seeing.</p><p>On the negative side the quality of the DVD transfer I watched was terrible 😞 </p>\n",

If I'd planned this properly I'd also have taken  a photo of the finished dish 🙁.\n\nI was attempting a vegan version of a Brazilian [feijoada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feijoada), loosely inspired by Jamie Oliver's _[Smoky veggie feijoada](https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/vegetables-recipes/smoky-veggie-feijoada/)_.\n\n### Ingredients\n\n500g dried Brazilian carioca beans (or pinto)\n\n1 kg (~12) medium/large carrots  \n12 vegan sausages  \n\n2 red onions \n4 cloves garlic \n5 sticks celery  \n1 or 2 red/yellow peppers  \n1 large courgette  \n700g passata  \n1/4 bottle red wine  \n\n8-10 fresh bay leaves  \ncinnamon stick  \n2 tsp ground coriander  \n2 tsp smoked paprika (plus extra for roasting the carrots)  \nfresh and/or dried thyme  \nfresh coriander  \n\n### Method\n\nSoak the beans overnight then rinse and put in a large pan with plenty of water, 4 or 5 bay leaves and a cinnamon stick. Bring to the boil, boil vigorously for 10 minutes then simmer for about 50 minutes until beans are tender but slightly firm. Do not overcook. Drain and set aside, reserving some of the stock.

The vegan sausages I used were by [Naked Glory](https://nakedglory.co.uk/). Any will do as long as they are quite firm and don't disintegrate into the stew. \n\n2. [Carioca](https://www.souschef.co.uk/products/carioca-pinto-beans?s=recomatic). Beans or feijão are a large part of the Brazilian diet, and pinto beans or carioca are one of the firm favourites. The most popular lunch in Brazil includes a serving of white rice along with cooked beans - so much so that the phrase arroz com feijão the \"rice and beans\" is a colloquial term used to mean the \"basics\".  \n\n3.
